1. First thing. Make sure that we fully understand the problem.
    1a. We know that the problem wants us to create an API.
    1b. We know that it needs to be an Inventory object.
    1c. We know that the inventory object needs the metadata: year, actors, imdb_rating, rotten_tomatoes_rating, film_locations
2. From this we can work backwards.
3. Make sure that we grab the necessary fields out of the API response
